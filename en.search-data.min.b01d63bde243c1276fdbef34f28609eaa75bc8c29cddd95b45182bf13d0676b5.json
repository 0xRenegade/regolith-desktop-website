Regolith 1.6\u0026rsquo;s primary feature is a return of the ISO installation method.\nFeatures #     Feature Screenshot Description     Return of Regolith Linux ISO   Up to Regolith 1.4.1, we hand-built each ISO for major version releases. This became too brittle and time intensive, and so work began on build automation to generate the ISO. This took quite awhile to complete but is now available for the 1.6 release.   New Look: Midnight   Fabian (naib864) has provided a distinctive new look with new font, icons, and GTK theme.   New Look: Solarized Light   Ricardo Pérez (ricpelo) has provided a solarized light theme.   New Status Indicator: app-launcher  Regolith user Laurent provided the idea to add a status indicator to launch Rofi, and so i3xrocks-app-launcher was added for those that prefer to use the mouse to launch apps.   Upgrades to i3-gaps and Rofi   i3-gaps is updated to 4.19.1 and Rofi to 1.6.1.

It may contain out of date information.  The Regolith project typically hosts a Git repository for every package not provided by an upstream project. This page lists these repositories and provides details regarding activity, summary of purpose, and last shipped version.\n"},{"id":7,"href":"/docs/using-regolith/basics/","title":"Basic Usage","section":"Using Regolith","content":"NOTICE: This page was copied from the Regolith 1.x website and has not been updated for Regolith 2. It may contain out of date information.  While we\u0026rsquo;ll cover everything in greater detail in other areas of the documentation, this page covers the very basics.\nThe Super Key #  Most keybindings you\u0026rsquo;ll be using with Regolith start with the super  key. This key typically says \u0026ldquo;WIN\u0026rdquo; or has a MS Windows logo on it. On a Mac it is the Command ⌘  key. Going forward, this key will simply be referred to as super  but keep in mind that you can change which physical button super  maps to in your configuration if you choose to.\nLaunchers #  Regolith provides several launchers as the primary way of interacting with your system. Each of these launchers has a consistent look and feel but provides access to a specific entity. Default launchers are provided for applications super space  , commands super shift space  , notifications super n  , windows super ctrl space  , and files super alt space  .\nLaunch an Application #  After logging in, you\u0026rsquo;ll be at a blank screen with the bar at the bottom and some keyboard shortcuts on the right. To launch an application, press super space  and a menu will be presented with all of the applications installed on the system. If you begin typing the name of the application you wish to launch, the list will filter down to only matching names. You can also scroll through the list with the arrow keys.\nNavigate to a Window #  To focus on a running application, the super ctrl space  keybinding can be used to show a dialog of all running windows. Simply select the desired window and the system will move to the window\u0026rsquo;s containing workspace and set its focus.\nCreate a new Workspace #  Workspaces (also known as virtual desktops in some desktop environments) are the primary way by which windows can be managed. Each workspace provides a screen for an independent set of windows. To create a workspace, super `  will create and move to a new workspace. super 0-9  allows for navigation to specific workspaces.\nFind and Launch a File #  Searching your local computer for a specific file can be achieved in a variety of ways. Regolith provides a file search dialog via super alt space  to quickly seek and optionally load a file with its default application. If the file path exceeds the width of the dialog, alt .  will toggle text justification. Pressing enter on a selection will cause the file to be invoked with the xdg-open command.\nTerminal #  The terminal is a special application that has its own keybinding, super enter  .\nBrowser #  The preferred browser is also special and can be launched with super shift enter  .\nQuit an Application #   super shift q  will quit the focused application. For misbehaving apps, super alt q  will force quit the focused application, but note that any unsaved data will likely be lost.\nSwitching Workspaces #  A primary way of managing how applications occupy the screen is by the usage of workspaces. A workspace is in essence a group of zero or more applications that all present windows on the same virtual display. Users can switch workspaces to \u0026ldquo;gain\u0026rdquo; more space for applications to occupy. Windows can be moved across workspaces. Workspaces can be tied to physical display or be moved to other displays as needed. To switch workspaces, hold down the super  key and press one of the number keys. This will navigate to that workspace. If any windows exist in a given workspace, it will show in the bar as being active. Thus, by referring to the bar the user can know in which workspaces active applications live.\nWorkspaces can also be paged forward and backward via super tab  and super shift tab  .\nConfiguring the System #  The Settings app (also known as gnome-control-center) is the primary interface for common configuration tasks, such as changing the desktop wallpaper, configuring WiFi and Bluetooth, configuring app associations and setting up users. The app can be launched via the super c  keybinding or from the launcher via the Settings app.\nFurther Reading #  More keybindings are listed in Remontoire, the shortcut application. This app is loaded automatically on the first session, but not on successive logins. The window can be toggled at any time by clicking the circled i  icon in the bar, or pressing super shift ?  .\n"},{"id":8,"href":"/docs/using-regolith/configuration/","title":"Configuration","section":"Using Regolith","content":"NOTICE: This page was copied from the Regolith 1.x website and has not been updated for Regolith 2. It may contain out of date information.  Wallpaper #  The wallpaper can be changed via Settings, or super c  , by going to the Background tab and selecting the preferred image or color.\nWallpaper can also be set via dotfiles for those that prefer file-based configuration management over GSettings.\nRegardless of which style you prefer, you can refer to the more extensive documentation for additional details.\nStatus Bar Indicators #  Status indicators such as CPU load, date and time, notifications, weather, and other system info can be added or removed by installing packages. For example, to show a status indicator for your laptop battery, simply run sudo apt install i3xrocks-battery and then refresh the session using regolith-look refresh. To find what indicators are available, run apt search ^i3xrocks- or search for i3xrocks- in your favorite package manager GUI, such as Synaptic. There is more documentation available for configuring status indicators, also called \u0026ldquo;blocklets\u0026rdquo;.\nLooks #  Colors, wallpaper, window and bar layouts and other visual factors are bundled together in Regolith and called \u0026ldquo;looks\u0026rdquo;. Looks provide a simple way of changing the entire look of the desktop with a few commands. Like status bar indicators, looks are packaged and are installed and removed like any other software package. By convention, Look packages use the following naming format regolith-look-\u0026lt;name\u0026gt;. apt or a GUI package manager can be used to search for available looks. The tool regolith-look can be used to change looks and refresh the active session with the selected look. Here\u0026rsquo;s an example that switches to the cahuella look that shipped by default in Regolith 1.3:\n$ apt search ^regolith-look- [...] regolith-look-cahuella/bionic,now 2.4.9 amd64 [...] $ sudo apt install regolith-look-cahuella $ regolith-look set cahuella $ regolith-look refresh Installed Looks may also be set via the Look Dialog, activated via super alt l  .\nKeybindings #  The most common keybinding change is the super  key. Regolith uses Xresources as the canonical source of truth for settings, which are read by various UI components. The table of Xresources keys open to user configuration is available elsewhere. To change the default super  binding from the \u0026ldquo;windows\u0026rdquo; key to \u0026ldquo;alt\u0026rdquo;, add the following line to the file ~/.config/regolith/Xresources:\ni3-wm.mod: Mod1 i3-wm.alt: Mod4 To change other, more advanced keybindings, creating a user copy of the i3 config file is necessary. We call this process \u0026ldquo;staging\u0026rdquo;.\nNote: GNOME also has it\u0026rsquo;s own set of keybindings. When the Regolith session is first initialized, the conflicting GNOME keybindings are removed from the user settings. GNOME keybindings can be managed in the Settings app.\nWindow Behavior #  Regolith uses an i3 window manager variant called i3-gaps. It controls how windows are drawn, how keybindings are configured, some start-up applications and other details. By default, the Regolith configuration file for i3 is located at /etc/regolith/i3/config.\nAlmost Everything Else #  The Settings app, or gnome-control-center as it\u0026rsquo;s also known, is the tool to configure locale, date, displays, networking and various other settings. Launch it via the app launcher with super space  , type settings, and hit enter to launch the app. The direct keybinding is super c  .\nFurther Reading #  To dig deeper, find which Howtos are available, or read the Xresources reference.

To summarize, Regolith 1.5 ships simpler workspace management, a Rofi-based Look switcher, and numerous internal optimizations and cleanup. Read below for more details.\nFeatures #     Feature Screenshot Description     Next Free Workspace  A typical part of managing workspaces in an i3-based desktop is moving to unused workspaces and then loading some applications. Before this feature, a user has to determine which unused workspace they prefer. This is done by scanning the list of existing used workspaces to determine an unused one. Now, the system can do this automatically. The super `  keybinding will move to the next free workspace. super alt `  will move the focused window into the next free workspace.   View and Change Looks via Rofi   Looks can be changed now via a Rofi dialog rather than having to configure the Xresources override via the command-line. To do this, use the keybinding super alt l  and then select a look from the dialog.   GSettings Overrides  Regolith now uses GSettings overrides to configure various GNOME settings for use with Regolith. In previous versions, settings were written globally to the user session from within the Regolith startup code. This could cause issues if the user works in multiple desktop environments. Now, the Regolith GNOME settings are defined in an override file that is only in effect while using a Regolith session. This allows switching between desktop environments without settings from Regolith impacting other environments.   New Looks   Users have contributed some new Looks to Regolith: Dracula, Gruvbox, and PopOs. Each of these looks presents a distinctive color palate, typeface, and GTK theme.   i3-gaps upgraded to 4.18.2  See the i3-gaps release notes for more information   More Refined Customizations  Numerous small changes allow more granular system customization, such as specifying the temperature unit, custom Compositor settings, and a more comprehensive way of changing i3 keybindings without having to copy the entire config file.   More Desktop Environment Packages  The following packages can be installed in place of regolith-desktop for specific sets of packages based on user needs: regolith-desktop-minimal, regolith-desktop-standard, regolith-desktop-mobile, and regolith-desktop-complete   New default compositor: Picom version 8  See the Picom release notes for more information on what has changed.   Remontoire upgraded to version 1.4  Includes better multi-monitor support and other bug fixes and enhancements.   Optional integration with td-cli   Access a simple todo app via Rofi.   Documentation of development process  The Regolith development process is now better documented for greater transparency and to foster inclusion.

In addition to the package updates, a new boot animation is provided by the package plymouth-theme-regolith that is installed by default on the ISO. The ISO also now excludes a deprecated touchpad driver that was conflicting with Settings. Existing PPA-based installations can simply get the updates via their typical package update process. Regolith Linux ISO users can update to R1.4.1 by applying regular package updates.\n"},{"id":18,"href":"/docs/reference/Releases/regolith-1.4-release-notes/","title":"1.4 Release Notes","section":"Releases","content":"Regolith R1.4 is a major feature release which includes several improvements and optimizations. Regolith is now smaller and more efficient. The ISO-based installer is now based from the Xubuntu image, and moves from the gdm3 display manager to LightDM. This allows for less resource consumption at runtime and dramatically smaller download size1. A new look, lascaille and file search dialog round out the major new features. Read below for more details.\nIf you maintain your own i3 config file, note that the copy shipped in Regolith 1.4 has changed in that it reads more configuration from Xresources. The intention of this change is to require a full copy of the i3 config file less often, by allowing users to customize the system via Xresource overrides instead of copy/edit of the i3 config file.  For R1.4 in particular @ploum has provided many of the ideas and validation. Gratitude goes out to Regolith contributors and users @cheginit, @nalderto, @baldrailers, @ivomarino, @Josh-Letts, @LawZava, @SkyyySi, @tomster, @gdeflaux, @appelgriebsch, @farsil, and @MrKovar for their time and attention. Also thanks to all that helped to test and filed issues for bugs and feature requests!\nKnown Issues #  Issues and fixes are being tracked in this project.\nFeatures #     Feature Screenshot Description     Remontoire 1.3.1   - Can render keybindings from i3 over socket or from any file. - Can be configured to display on any screen edge. - Visual updates and bug fixes. - Presentation changeable via CSS.   New default look: Lascaille   A new look with a bolder, tighter typeface and a darker, higher contrast color theme has become Regolith\u0026rsquo;s default look in 1.4. Cahuella and other looks continue to be available and can be installed with a few commands.   New File Search Dialog   Based on Rofi and mlocate, users can now quickly find files and launch their default editors from a global dialog.   Faster, Easier Customization  Virtually everything exportable from the i3 config can now be overridden directly with Xresources declarations, from changing the meta key to specifying the command that launches the app search dialog. Additionally, up to 3 user configured programs can be set to start upon session initialization. All of this is possible without creating a user copy of the i3 config file, but rather by overriding a specific Xresources.   i3xrocks supports conf.d style configuration  The status indicators in the bar can now be installed and configured independently. This allows for a cleaner dependency model and more efficient runtime characteristics. It also provides future flexibility for user contributed modules and status indicators. Plus, users can provide their own block descriptors in the user directory to easily override the defaults without having to change the i3 config file.   New architecture support: arm64  With testing done on a Raspberry Pi 4, Regolith now is installable via PPA when using Ubuntu on arm64 devices with the necessary hardware support.   Rewrite of Rofication  Rofication has been rewritten to require less dependencies and be more stable by Regolith contributor @farsil.   New Ubuntu release support: Focal Fossa   Regolith runs as a desktop environment in Canonical\u0026rsquo;s latest release of Ubuntu: 20.04 \u0026ldquo;Focal Fossa\u0026rdquo;   Time and Space Optimizations in ISO release  By switching from GDM3 to LightDM, Regolith avoids loading some unnecessary desktop components into RAM, resulting in between 200MB to 300MB savings on cold start. Additionally, the LiveCD installer is now based on the Xubuntu LiveCD which dramatically lowers the size of the installer and install image of the system2. Finally, with more fine-grained control of the bar status blocks, only the blocks you\u0026rsquo;ve installed will run.   Pluggable Desktop Notification Components  Users can now cleanly switch between desktop notification implementations such as dunst and notify-osd, in addition to Rofication without resorting to hacks.   Integrate gnome-terminal over st-term by Default   Regolith 1.4 uses gnome-terminal with a dynamically generated profile to overcome some character encoding and input devices. st is still available, simply by installing the regolith-st package.   Picom (Compton) config can be overriden by user  Users can provide their own Picom compositor config in their user directory.   i3 reload becomes Regolith reload  Refreshing the UI (look, colors, fonts, etc.) after making changes is now as easy as super shift r  .   Polish, polish, polish  Just as in previous releases, many tiny fixes and enhancements were added to Regolith in version 1.4.    Fixes #  Have a look at the R1.4 project page for a list of bug fixes.\n  This does not mean that Regolith uses Xfce4 or any other aspect of Xubuntu other than the install image. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n The trade-off is that users need to install more of the software they require after installation. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n   "},{"id":19,"href":"/docs/reference/Releases/regolith-1.3.1-release-notes/","title":"1.3.1 Release Notes","section":"Releases","content":"R1.3.1 is a quick followup to R1.3 that adds polish and usability features. Headlining features include a more concise way of overriding Xresource defaults and several enhancements to the Remontoire keybinding viewer.\nIf you maintain your own i3 config file, note that the copy shipped in Regolith 1.3.1 has changed in that the comment format has been modified to be readable by Remontoire ( example). Without updating your copy i3 config comments, you will not see any keybindings.  Features #     Feature Screenshot Description     Remontoire 1.1.1   Provides a live view of active i3 keybindings, introduces a machine-readable comment format for i3 config files, and fixes several layout and presentation bugs reported by users.   Ayu Looks   The community contributed Ayu themes have been fully integrated into Regolith with updates to package dependencies and configurations.   Rofi polishing   Numerous updates to the Rofi themes for all provided looks.   Easier Customization  Now, overriding specific Xresources values can be easily done by supplying only the overrides in ~/.config/regolith/Xresources without needing to copying and update any existing files. Additionally, any Xresources files in ~/.config/regolith/Xresources.d can be referenced without absolute path, enabling easier multi-machine configurations.   Utilize GNOME and update-alternatives for Default Apps  GNOME settings for default browser and update-alternatives for preferred terminal are now used by Regolith. No custom configuration changes are required.   Xresources updates  More UI configuration pulled out of component configs and into Xresources provides more flexibility in how custom looks can be.   Locale used for date/time format  For those not using the US date and time formats, the bar clock will now automatically use the GNOME hour format and the locale LC_TIME setting to automatically display date and time in the regional form without configuration.   UI tweaks and polishing   Many small updates across all UI components to further polish the interface, including a new optional dark background adapted from work by /u/InfernusZ9.

Keybindings Dialog   To allow for a more consistent look and collapsible content for various monitor dimensions, a custom shortcut dialog was developed called Remontoire.   Pluggable Compositors  The subsystem providing visual effects, the compositor, can behave differently based on hardware and driver support. Regolith now packages 3 compositor backends: compton-glx (based on Picom), xcompmgr, and none.   i3-snapshot  In office environments it is common to switch between various display configurations (desk, meeting room\u0026hellip;). i3-snapshot allows the user to quickly save and restore existing window layouts in a session.   New Rofi theme   Based on work by /u/InfernusZ9, the Rofi launcher is less distracting.   New notification UI based on Rofication  The previous notification UI was a hold over from more traditional desktop environments that prefer to present an on-screen dialog when a notification is received. Because user-focus is paramount, this was changed such that an indicator in the bar displays the number of unread notifications and the user decides when to view them via a keybinding or button click.   Floating Control Panel  The gnome-control-center app can have a hard time adapting to constrained tiled layouts common with i3-wm. Now when the control panel is loaded, it floats above the existing windows to allow for a quick settings change without impacting other apps.   Clickable Bar Status Actions  For convienence, the default blocks on the bar will launch configuration apps for the associated block. For example, the battery block will launch the power settings control panel, and the notification block will launch the notification viewer.   Discrete and packagable Looks  The underlying style framework used by Regolith has been revamped to allow for \u0026ldquo;looks\u0026rdquo;: colors, themes, typeface, and other thematic state. Looks can be switched with a single command.   New bar status components  Network, keybindings, notifications, focused window, and other blocklets have been improved and added.   Build System  Build scripts were added and improved to allow for the generation of Regolith packages in an automated fashion, making it easier for others to roll their own.

Adding or Removing status indicators #  Finding Status Indicators #  $ apt search i3xrocks- Installing a Status Indicator #  $ sudo apt install i3xrocks-memory $ regolith-look refresh Customization of the i3 bar #  Each status indicator on the bar is managed by a file. The name of the file maps to the position of the status indicator on the bar, e.g. a file\u0026rsquo;s name starting with 10_ mean its corresponding indicator will be positioned before an indicator which has a configuration file starting with 20_. Within each file there is some information that i3xrocks uses to execute a script that ultimately returns the data you see on the bar. Some of the status indicators have configuration parameters that can be adjusted to your liking. For example, if you would prefer that the battery status changes more frequently, the polling interval can be updated. The first thing to do in order to customize the bar is to copy the indicators you wish to see from /etc/regolith/i3xrocks/conf.d to ~/.config/regolith/i3xrocks/conf.d. Each file in ~/.config/regolith/i3xrocks/conf.d can be modified as you see fit. To change the order of status indicators on the bar, simply change the name of the files to the sort order you prefer.\nOnce you\u0026rsquo;ve made your changes, refreshing the session should cause the bar to update based on your new configuration.\nFor example, to change the order of the battery and net traffic blocks on the bar and not display notifications, perform the following steps:\n$ ls /etc/regolith/i3xrocks/conf.d 01_setup 30_net-traffic 80_battery 80_rofication 90_time $ mkdir -p ~/.config/regolith/i3xrocks/conf.d $ cd /etc/regolith/i3xrocks/conf.d $ cp 01_setup ~/.config/regolith/i3xrocks/conf.d/01_setup $ cp 80_battery ~/.config/regolith/i3xrocks/conf.d/30_battery $ cp 30_net-traffic ~/.config/regolith/i3xrocks/conf.d/80_net-traffic $ regolith-look refresh Note: If any block configuration exists in the user directory ~/.config/regolith/i3xrocks/conf.d, then the defaults in /etc/regolith/i3xrocks/conf.d will be ignored.\nFurther Reading #  The reference page for configurations has more details about the configuration files used with Regolith Linux.\n"},{"id":23,"href":"/docs/howtos/replace-notification-system/","title":"Change Notification Systems","section":"How To","content":"NOTICE: This page was copied from the Regolith 1.x website and has not been updated for Regolith 2.

Adding icons to workspaces can give your desktop a nice and functional look.\nFinding icons #  Icons are actually characters from fonts installed by Regolith looks. Each look comes with a specific icon font. The icon font is defined in the typeface_bar variable in the typeface config file. For example, the look \u0026ldquo;Cahuella\u0026rdquo; uses the Material Design Icons font (see file /etc/regolith/styles/cahuella/typeface).\nYou can browse the icon font using the Gnome Character Map application from the gucharmap package:\n Open \u0026ldquo;Gnome Character Map\u0026rdquo;. Select your icon font in the top left combo. In the script pane select Common. Scroll down the characters pane until you find the icons.

It may contain out of date information.  Regolith relies on the Xresources system to provide a consolidated interface configuration. By changing Xresources values, Regolith can be customized in ways such as updating the user interface, specifying custom behaviors, or defining a specific format for some of the blocklets on the bar.\nIn Regolith, Xresources values can be changed via two methods: supplying your own Xresources files, and overriding the existing Xresources values. The latter approach is strongly recommended, as it makes upgrading to newer versions of Regolith less likely to break your customizations. If you copy the Xresources tree completely you\u0026rsquo;ll need to integrate any breaking changes in future versions manually.  Initialization #  When a Regolith session is started, Xresources are loaded in the following order:\n   File Optional Notes     ~/.Xresources Y Intended for non-Regolith settings   ~/.Xresources-regolith Y A global override to replace all Regolith settings   /etc/regolith/styles/root N The default Regolith Xresources file if ~/.Xresources-regolith does not exist   ~/.config/regolith/Xresources Y Applies specific overrides to Xresources defaults    It is recommended to use ~/.config/regolith/Xresources for customization as it doesn\u0026rsquo;t require the specification of redundant settings and is easier to maintain over time.\nDetermining which values can be changed #  The xrdb tool can be used to list the existing Xresources values. There is a number of existing overrides in the R1.4.1 release:\n$ xrdb -query [...] gnome.icon.theme:\tMoka gnome.terminal.font:\tJetBrains Mono 12 gnome.terminal.scrollbar:\tnever gnome.wallpaper:\t/usr/share/backgrounds/ESP_016895_1525_desktop.jpg gnome.wm.theme:\tAyu-Mirage-Dark [...] Examples #  Note that the commands presented below append text to a file, so running the command more than once will result in duplicate entires.\nExample - Update the UI for High DPI Screens #  By using the ~/.config/regolith/Xresources override file, we will only need to specify the values we wish to change. The xrdb tool can be used to determine what current values are set to.\n Create or add the following value to your ~/.config/regolith/Xresources file:  Xft.dpi: 192 Reload the Xresources configuration:  $ regolith-look refresh Open a new terminal to see the change take effect.  192 is just an example value, please adjust as needed.\nExample - Change i3 bar position #  $ xrdb -query | grep position i3-wm.bar.position:\tbottom $ echo \u0026quot;i3-wm.bar.position:\ttop\u0026quot; \u0026gt;\u0026gt; ~/.config/regolith/Xresources $ regolith-look refresh Example - Change GTK Theme #  $ xrdb -query | grep gtk gnome.gtk.theme:\tAyu-Mirage-Dark $ echo \u0026quot;gnome.gtk.theme:\tAdwaita\u0026quot; \u0026gt;\u0026gt; ~/.config/regolith/Xresources $ regolith-look refresh Example - Disable the System Tray #  $ echo \u0026quot;i3-wm.bar.trayoutput:\tnone\u0026quot; \u0026gt;\u0026gt; ~/.config/regolith/Xresources $ regolith-look refresh Example - Use Alt instead of Win as Super #  $ echo \u0026quot;i3-wm.mod: Mod1\u0026quot; \u0026gt;\u0026gt; ~/.config/regolith/Xresources $ echo \u0026quot;i3-wm.alt: Mod4\u0026quot; \u0026gt;\u0026gt; ~/.config/regolith/Xresources Then Reload i3 for the change to take effect (on Regolith 1.5+ there is an active regression here with a temporary fix in the issue)\nExample - Launch nm-applet when i3 starts #  Some users prefer to use the nm-applet program to configure and manage their wireless network (from Regolith 1.5 onwards nm-applet is run by default in the background). i3 config file can be updated to launch any arbitrary program at start time.

It may contain out of date information.  If you only wish to override or provide new Xresources values, staging configs is not required and not recommended. Overriding Xresources value is described in a separate article.  Regolith uses a number of files in /etc/regolith to determine the behavior and look of various components. While it\u0026rsquo;s possible to simply edit these files directly, users who do so run the risk of having their configurations overwritten upon future updates. The Debian packaging system should ask users if they wish to take updates or keep the existing files, but this may have unintended side effects if users take partial updates of files. As such Regolith, upon login, will look for user-staged version of configuration files and load those instead of the defaults if they exist. This is recommended over editing the files in /etc/regolith directly as it gives the user more control over their configuration. This page describes how to create these files.\nDepending on what you wish to change, you may need your own copy if the i3 config file, Xresources, or both. If you\u0026rsquo;re looking to change the way Regolith looks, Xresources may be all you need.
