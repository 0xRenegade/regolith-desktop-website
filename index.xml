This can make the first time experience a bit confusing. However using the Regolith interface is relatively simple by only committing the following two keybindings to memory:

In addition to the package updates, a new boot animation is provided by the package plymouth-theme-regolith that is installed by default on the ISO. The ISO also now excludes a deprecated touchpad driver that was conflicting with Settings. Existing PPA-based installations can simply get the updates via their typical package update process.</description></item><item><title>1.4 Release Notes</title><link>https://regolith-desktop.com/docs/reference/Releases/regolith-1.4-release-notes/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://regolith-desktop.com/docs/reference/Releases/regolith-1.4-release-notes/</guid><description>Regolith R1.4 is a major feature release which includes several improvements and optimizations. Regolith is now smaller and more efficient. The ISO-based installer is now based from the Xubuntu image, and moves from the gdm3 display manager to LightDM. This allows for less resource consumption at runtime and dramatically smaller download size1. A new look, lascaille and file search dialog round out the major new features.

Headlining features include a more concise way of overriding Xresource defaults and several enhancements to the Remontoire keybinding viewer.
If you maintain your own i3 config file, note that the copy shipped in Regolith 1.3.1 has changed in that the comment format has been modified to be readable by Remontoire (example). Without updating your copy i3 config comments, you will not see any keybindings.</description></item><item><title>1.3 Release Notes</title><link>https://regolith-desktop.com/docs/reference/Releases/regolith-1.3-release-notes/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://regolith-desktop.com/docs/reference/Releases/regolith-1.3-release-notes/</guid><description>Following R1.2, the 1.3 release focused on usability issues reported by users and a continuing refinement of the desktop environment in general, with a focus on making the system easier for those inexperienced with tiling window managers.

The Regolith project is built upon many projects.
The following projects in particular deserve special mention:
The i3 community, including Michael Stapelberg and Ingo Bürk. The Rofi community, including Dave Davenport. Picom, an actively maintained desktop compositor, including yshui. The Gnome Flashback project, supported by Alberts Muktupāvels and Dmitry Shachnev.</description></item><item><title>Assign a workspace to a specific Output (Display)</title><link>https://regolith-desktop.com/docs/howtos/workspace-on-output/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://regolith-desktop.com/docs/howtos/workspace-on-output/</guid><description>NOTICE: This page was copied from the Regolith 1.x website and has not been updated for Regolith 2.

Rather, a small bar item displays the current number of unread notifications and a dialog can activated to interact with the content of the current notifications.</description></item><item><title>Change the Bar Date and Time Format</title><link>https://regolith-desktop.com/docs/howtos/time-format/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://regolith-desktop.com/docs/howtos/time-format/</guid><description>NOTICE: This page was copied from the Regolith 1.x website and has not been updated for Regolith 2.

To update Regolith to use your already installed terminal of your choice, use update-alternatives to specify it as default:
Run update-alternatives --config x-terminal-emulator to see all available terminals installed on your system.

It may contain out of date information. Regolith relies on the Xresources system to provide a consolidated interface configuration. By changing Xresources values, Regolith can be customized in ways such as updating the user interface, specifying custom behaviors, or defining a specific format for some of the blocklets on the bar.</description></item><item><title>Remove Unneeded Dependencies</title><link>https://regolith-desktop.com/docs/howtos/remove-unneeded-deps/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://regolith-desktop.com/docs/howtos/remove-unneeded-deps/</guid><description>When Regolith is installed via ISO, only the necessary desktop components or packages are installed by default. However when installing Regolith into an existing Ubuntu system, some desktop components that Regolith does not require will still be installed on the system. There is nothing wrong with keeping these additional packages, in fact they are important if you wish to switch back to the default Ubuntu session at some point, however some users prefer to remove them.</description></item><item><title>Stage Config Files</title><link>https://regolith-desktop.com/docs/howtos/stage-configs/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://regolith-desktop.com/docs/howtos/stage-configs/</guid><description>If you only wish to override or provide new Xresources values, staging configs is not required and not recommended. Overriding Xresources value is described in a separate article. Regolith uses a number of configuration files to determine the behavior and look of various components. While it&amp;rsquo;s possible to simply edit these files directly, users who do so run the risk of having their configurations overwritten upon future updates. The Debian packaging system should ask users if they wish to take updates or keep the existing files, but this may have unintended side effects if users take partial updates of files.</description></item><item><title>Support Multiple Batteries</title><link>https://regolith-desktop.com/docs/howtos/multiple-batteries/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://regolith-desktop.com/docs/howtos/multiple-batteries/</guid><description>NOTICE: This page was copied from the Regolith 1.x website and has not been updated for Regolith 2. It may contain out of date information. Out of the box the primary battery status will be displayed in the i3-bar. For some laptops that have multiple batteries, e.g. ThinkPads, you want to have both batteries displayed:
Stage your i3xrocks configuration files, then open ~/.config/regolith2/i3xrocks/conf.d/80_battery in your editor of choice. Find the line that pertains to the battery blocklet: # Battery indicator # # Displays total percentage charge left of specified battery.</description></item><item><title>Verify behavior against upstream</title><link>https://regolith-desktop.com/docs/howtos/gnome-flashback-session/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://regolith-desktop.com/docs/howtos/gnome-flashback-session/</guid><description>NOTICE: This page was copied from the Regolith 1.x website and has not been updated for Regolith 2. It may contain out of date information. Regolith is composed of several existing open-source projects plus some additional custom packages. Sometimes when a bug is found in Regolith, actually it&amp;rsquo;s a bug in an upstream project. Determining the source of bugs is a first step in getting them fixed.
Check gnome-flashback # Most of Regolith&amp;rsquo;s GNOME support comes from the gnome-flashback project.</description></item></channel></rss>
