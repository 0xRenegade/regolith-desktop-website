Features # Feature Screenshot Description Next Free Workspace A typical part of managing workspaces in an i3-based desktop is moving to unused workspaces and then loading some applications.</description></item><item><title>1.4.1 Release Notes</title><link>https://regolith-desktop.org/docs/reference/Releases/regolith-1.4.1-release-notes/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://regolith-desktop.org/docs/reference/Releases/regolith-1.4.1-release-notes/</guid><description>Regolith R1.4.1 is a fast follow up to 1.4 that fixes a few serious bugs, detailed on the mailing list. In addition to the package updates, a new boot animation is provided by the package plymouth-theme-regolith that is installed by default on the ISO. The ISO also now excludes a deprecated touchpad driver that was conflicting with Settings. Existing PPA-based installations can simply get the updates via their typical package update process.</description></item><item><title>1.4 Release Notes</title><link>https://regolith-desktop.org/docs/reference/Releases/regolith-1.4-release-notes/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://regolith-desktop.org/docs/reference/Releases/regolith-1.4-release-notes/</guid><description>Regolith R1.4 is a major feature release which includes several improvements and optimizations. Regolith is now smaller and more efficient. The ISO-based installer is now based from the Xubuntu image, and moves from the gdm3 display manager to LightDM. This allows for less resource consumption at runtime and dramatically smaller download size1. A new look, lascaille and file search dialog round out the major new features. Read below for more details.</description></item><item><title>1.3.1 Release Notes</title><link>https://regolith-desktop.org/docs/reference/Releases/regolith-1.3.1-release-notes/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://regolith-desktop.org/docs/reference/Releases/regolith-1.3.1-release-notes/</guid><description>R1.3.1 is a quick followup to R1.3 that adds polish and usability features. Headlining features include a more concise way of overriding Xresource defaults and several enhancements to the Remontoire keybinding viewer.
If you maintain your own i3 config file, note that the copy shipped in Regolith 1.3.1 has changed in that the comment format has been modified to be readable by Remontoire ( example). Without updating your copy i3 config comments, you will not see any keybindings.</description></item><item><title>1.3 Release Notes</title><link>https://regolith-desktop.org/docs/reference/Releases/regolith-1.3-release-notes/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://regolith-desktop.org/docs/reference/Releases/regolith-1.3-release-notes/</guid><description>Following R1.2, the 1.3 release focused on usability issues reported by users and a continuing refinement of the desktop environment in general, with a focus on making the system easier for those inexperienced with tiling window managers.
