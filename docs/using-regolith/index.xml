This can make the first time experience a bit confusing. However using the Regolith interface is relatively simple by only committing the following two keybindings to memory:

The Super Key # Most keybindings you&amp;rsquo;ll be using with Regolith start with the super key. This key typically says &amp;ldquo;WIN&amp;rdquo; or has a MS Windows logo on it. On a Mac it is the Command âŒ˜ key. Going forward, this key will simply be referred to as super but keep in mind that you can change which physical button super maps to in your configuration if you choose to.</description></item><item><title>Configuration</title><link>https://regolith-desktop.com/docs/using-regolith/configuration/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://regolith-desktop.com/docs/using-regolith/configuration/</guid><description>Configuration # Wallpaper # The wallpaper can be changed via the Settings app, or super c , by going to the Background tab and selecting the preferred image.
Wallpaper can also be set via dotfiles for those that prefer file-based configuration management. This can be done by specifying the path to the wallpaper image via the Xresources key gnome.wallpaper.
Regardless of which style you prefer, you can refer to the more extensive documentation for additional details.</description></item></channel></rss>
