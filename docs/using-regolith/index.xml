The Super Key # Most keybindings you&amp;rsquo;ll be using with Regolith start with the super key. This key typically says &amp;ldquo;WIN&amp;rdquo; or has a MS Windows logo on it. On a Mac it is the Command âŒ˜ key. Going forward, this key will simply be referred to as super but keep in mind that you can change which physical button super maps to in your configuration if you choose to.</description></item><item><title>Configuration</title><link>https://regolith-desktop.com/docs/using-regolith/configuration/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://regolith-desktop.com/docs/using-regolith/configuration/</guid><description>NOTICE: This page was copied from the Regolith 1.x website and has not been updated for Regolith 2.
